        <p>When I chose to revamp AdrianArtiles.com from a static site to something that I can share work and writings on, I quickly set to work whiteboarding everything I wanted from the new site. This narrowed my choice to two options for the framework; wordpress, and octopress/jekyll.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Now let me start by saying I love wordpress. I&rsquo;ve used it for several years and have relied on it for several projects for both myself and for clients. Initially I thought I would be using wordpress, but after further consideration it started to seem like it wasn&rsquo;t the right fit.</p>

<p>My first requirement that it had to be easy to use. When I say &ldquo;easy to use&rdquo;, I mean so in every sense; installing it, maintaining it, updating it, writing entries for it, hacking it up and customizing it to whatever I need, and so on. I have enough things that require effort and attention in my life, AdrianArtiles.com doesn&rsquo;t need to be one of them.</p>

<p>Now wordpress is not difficult to use. I&rsquo;ve installed it countless times on vps&rsquo;s, amazon instances, shared hosting, heroku, etc., etc.. Authoring a new post only takes a few minutes. Assuming you know PHP, altering a theme, plugin, or anything really only takes a minimal amount of fiddling.</p>

<p>But for my needs it seemed a little heavy. First of all, I didn&rsquo;t want to deal with a database. I wanted my new site to be as simple and light weight as possible, and I felt there was something out there lighter than wordpress that can do what I wanted.</p>

<p>Now if I just wanted a care-free, &ldquo;no frills&rdquo; blogging solution, I could do that anywhere. I could easily turn to tumblr and be done with it, but I also wanted to be able to hack it up and customize it however I wanted, control the experience as much or as little as I wanted to, or maybe repurpose a part of the site for something else.</p>

<p>So the solution would have to be light-weight and flexible. Bonus points for using a technology that I like working with that helps me achieve this. Something in ruby perhaps?</p>

<p>With these requirements I set out to see what best matched the bill.</p>

<h3>enter octopress</h3>

<p>I heard about <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> before, but at the time I didn&rsquo;t give it much thought. &ldquo;Why would I want to work with something so bare-bones when there are so many other full featured and customizable options&rdquo; I asked outloudly to my computer screen. I laughed to myself and installed wordpress for the umpteenth time.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today and my quest for my new framework. I came across <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, which is built on top of jekyll. It was polished, feature-filled, easy to use (if you&rsquo;re a developer of any sort), and lightweight.</p>

<p>What I loved about Octopress/Jekyll was the overhead. It was just files. No database, and I get everything I want. I just write the posts that I want locally with any text editor (currently vim, with the very occasional sublime text), <code>rake generate</code>, and I have the files that are my site! Now I can take those files and host them anywhere and I have my site. So I can put it on an amazon instance, heroku, appfog, a laptop connected to the internet in a basement, whatever, anything that can host a few files. No database to configure, maintain, or worry myself with.</p>

<p>Since it&rsquo;s written in ruby, if I wanted to get in there and change something up I easily could. Most of the configuration I wanted could be achieved with plugins, themes, and old fashioned css and javascript. Now I could SEO, tweak, and design to my heart&rsquo;s content, which so far as turned into this theme (which I made open sourced and available via <a href="https://github.com/sevenadrian/foxslide">github</a>).</p>

<p>Besides being able to use whatever text editor I like, I&rsquo;d be writing in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a>. Markdown is an easy to use &ldquo;shorthand&rdquo; for writing for websites. It makes creating links, headers, quotes, lists, those kind of things, very easy to do.</p>

<p>Another advantage is <em>version control</em>. If you are a software developer and you don&rsquo;t use version control, you are a danger to yourself and to others around you. For those who use version control, the advantages in using it for a blog should be obvious. For those not familiar with version control, take a look at a very popular distributed version control called <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>. Basically it allows you to save a &ldquo;copy&rdquo; of your site at every step of the way, and giving you the ability to see changes over time and revert to a specific point at any time. Use a hosted git solution like <a href="http://github.com">github</a> and never have to worry about losing any part of your website again.</p>

<p>So far I&rsquo;m happy with the decision I&rsquo;ve made. I got everything I was looking for in the package I want. Now let&rsquo;s hope I write often enough to take advantage of it.</p>
