I am sitting at a Starbucks after quickly enjoying the return of their smoked butter scotch frappuccino with an extra
shot. I brought my laptop and a book which I recently checked out of the public library, Learning SQL by Alan Beaulieu. 
SQL was a major role in my last position, modifying reports for management, creating dashboards, and querying for data in 
the backend to clear up dupes or errors in data entry. I do not want to lose this knowledge nor do I want to keep not 
using this powerful tool for businesses. Also, I have revived this blog and are further expanding my use of the command 
line through git and this site.                                                                                             

On a side note, I find myself questioning what I do. I have taken it a step further and went to a CSUCI information 
session to see if a teaching credential is something I would like to pursue. It would take anywhere from a year and a half 
to three to complete the program. I am getting mixed signals and are unsure. Although with my current situation I find it 
that maybe it is something to kill and pass the time rather than making it a full time career. Even though people may say 
I am good with kids, doubts of not equiping our young next generation is daunting, but something I would enjoy and see as 
a challenge. Equiping young minds with the right tools at an early stage can help them be on the long road to succeding in 
the education machine.
