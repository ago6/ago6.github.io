Debbi and I took a last minute trip to Big Bear. We had a rough morning 
after a night out in Downtown Fullerton in celebration of Liviers birthday.
Big Bear was fun, cold, and exciting to have done so with the puppies. We
ate at one of the best burger joints, Get The Burger, everyone should try 
or check this place out if in the area.
