I am glad to be back using github and to continue building on my personal site, once a hobbie that I
should have never stopped for three years. The old Dell Latitude, E5410 running Ubuntu is still going and
helping me while possibly transitioning to a new rig. A new start and an itch to learn have turned me to
make a change to Gatsby and possibly adding Adsense as a test or down the line. Thank you to all who will
read this or randomly stumble upon it by going to gomezalejandro.com just because we share the same name.
(The custom Domain name was the kickstart to all of this :D)
