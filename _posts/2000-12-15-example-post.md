## Introducing Flex, a Jekyll theme this is what I added

outside

Flex is a minimalist, responsive theme based on the website, [The Development](http://thedevelopment.co). I have chosen this as my first sample of a static website through GitHub. I have modified what I can for now and will keep updating.

## Open Sourced on GitHu

Flex is open sourced on GitHub and is licensed under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). Feel free to contribute to it anytime!
