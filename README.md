This site is made possible with Jekyll. Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through Markdown (or Textile) and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.
